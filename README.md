# Modern Companions (NeoForge 1.21.1)

## ⬇️ Download

### **[➤ Download ModernCompanions.jar](https://github.com/Somethingdum/ModernCompanions/releases/latest/download/ModernCompanions.jar)**

That link always gives you the newest build as **one single `.jar` file**. Nothing to unzip.

**Installing it, start to finish:**

1. Install the **[NeoForge installer for Minecraft 1.21.1](https://neoforged.net/)** and run it once (pick *Install client*). This adds a NeoForge profile to your Minecraft launcher.
2. Click the download link above. You get one file: `ModernCompanions.jar`.
3. Open your `mods` folder:
   - **Windows:** press `Win + R`, paste `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods`, press Enter
   - **macOS:** Finder → Go → Go to Folder → `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods`
   - **Linux:** `~/.minecraft/mods`
   - If there is no `mods` folder, just create one with that exact name.
4. Drop `ModernCompanions.jar` into it. Do not unzip it — Minecraft wants the `.jar` as-is.
5. In the Minecraft launcher, select the **NeoForge 1.21.1** profile and hit Play.

> If the download link 404s, no build has been published yet. Check the
> [Actions tab](https://github.com/Somethingdum/ModernCompanions/actions) — the jar is built

**Optional extras** (the mod works fine without any of them): Curios, Sophisticated Backpacks,
Jade or WTHIT, JEI, Epic Fight, Iron's Spellbooks or Ars Nouveau, TacZ.

Modern Companions is a NeoForge 1.21.1 port and rebrand of [Human Companions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/human-companions), with new branding, Soul Gems, a Summoning Wand, custom weapons, optional magic companions, firearm specialists, and deeper companion progression.

Supported specialties:

- SMG
- Rifle
- Shotgun
- Sniper
- Machine Gun
- Heavy

Specialists use TacZ’s native shooting, ammunition, reload, and weapon behavior. Matching summon gems are available only when TacZ is installed.

## How It Plays

1. **Find:** Locate a companion structure in the Overworld.
2. **Hire:** Right-click an untamed companion with the exact requested food and resource items.
3. **Tame:** Fulfill both requested stacks to unlock the companion and its inventory.
4. **Command:** Use the companion screen to select Follow, Patrol, Guard, Alert, Hunting, Sprint, Pickup, Clear, Release, and Radius controls.
5. **Equip:** Give companions armor, weapons, tools, shields, torches, or lanterns through their inventory.
6. **Progress:** Companions gain XP from kills and improve as they level.
7. **Recover:** Feed injured companions, use beneficial potions, or revive fallen tamed companions with Resurrection Scrolls.
8. **Regroup:** Use the Summoning Wand to recall all living companions and Beastmaster pets in the current dimension.

Following companions use their saved Radius for wandering and recall. Radius values range from 2 to 128 blocks.

## Taming and Upkeep

Each untamed companion requests two specific stacks of food or resources.

- Resource tiers are weighted as 70% common, 25% uncommon, and 5% rare.
- Nether and ocean resources remain unavailable until the player has reached those areas.
- The final resource requirement is resolved on the first interaction and then saved.
- Empty-hand interactions produce companion dialogue.
- Wrong food produces a different response from the companion.
- Companions can eat cooked food, vegetables, fruit, honey, enchanted golden foods, and beneficial potions.
- Companions remember their favorite food and gain improved Bond and Morale rewards when fed it.
- Set `companion.lowHealthFoodThreshold` from `0.0` to `1.0` to control when companions eat or ask for food. The default is `0.5`.

## Inventory and Equipment

![Inventory](https://i.imgur.com/6iCmeTL.png)

Each companion has:

- A 7×9 personal inventory.
- Dedicated helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots, main-hand, and offhand slots.
- A 3D inventory preview.
- Automatic armor and weapon selection.
- Optional automatic gear equip from the companion inventory (disabled by default).
- Separate cosmetic armor slots with per-slot visibility toggles; cosmetic items change appearance without replacing functional equipment.
- Persistent equipment through relogging, capture, and redeployment.
- Owner-only villager and PvP safety controls.

Equipment rules keep companions from grabbing unsuitable items:

- Main hand: tools and weapons.
- Offhand: shields, torches, and lanterns.
- Manually equipped items remain protected from automatic replacement.

## Companion Resources and Potions

Every companion has 100 Stamina by default. Sprinting and successful melee attacks consume Stamina. At zero Stamina, sprinting pauses and melee attacks use a slower cadence.

Magic companions also have 100 Mana. Spell costs are applied only after a spell successfully casts.

Five reusable vessel shapes support six potion types:

- **Health:** Restores health immediately.
- **Regeneration:** Heals over time.
- **Stamina:** Restores companion Stamina.
- **Mana:** Restores companion Mana.
- **Rejuvenation:** Restores health, Stamina, and Mana over time.
- **Shield:** Grants temporary armor.

Brewing recipes are visible in JEI, and used potions return their matching empty vessels.

### Potion Recipes

Craft one of the five reusable empty vessels, fill it with a Water Bottle, and brew it with Nether Wart to create the matching Empty Vessel. Add the listed ingredients in a Brewing Stand to finish the potion.

![Empty vessel crafting recipes](https://i.imgur.com/tw4koGa.gif)

![Complete companion potion guide](https://i.imgur.com/5AGBSZR.gif)

Each potion returns its matching empty vessel after use. Health restores immediately, Regeneration heals over time, Stamina and Mana restore their matching companion resource, Rejuvenation restores all three over time, and Shield grants temporary armor.

### Stamina Configuration

- `companion.staminaEnabled`: Set to `false` to disable the Stamina system completely.
- `companion.sprintStaminaCost`: Stamina spent per sprinting tick. Default: `1`.
- `companion.meleeStaminaCost`: Stamina spent per successful melee hit. Default: `8`.

Both cost settings accept values from `0` to `100`. A value of `0` disables that individual drain.

When Stamina is disabled, companions keep a full Stamina pool, continue sprinting and attacking normally, and the Jade Stamina bar is hidden. Mana remains active for magic companions.

## Curios and Sophisticated Backpacks

Both integrations are optional.

### Curios

- Companions expose Curios slots when Curios is installed.
- Curio rendering can be toggled per companion.
- All TacZ firearm specialists support the same Curios integration.

### Sophisticated Backpacks

Equip a Sophisticated Backpack in a companion’s Curios back slot.

- Picked-up items are inserted into the backpack before the companion’s normal inventory.
- The Pack button opens Sophisticated Backpacks’ native storage screen.
- Backpack upgrades and settings remain available.
- Backpack equipment persists when companions are captured and redeployed.

## Personality, Morale, Bond, and Journal

![Journal](https://i.imgur.com/F8KB9kT.png)

The Journal displays:

- Traits and their effects.
- Backstory.
- Morale descriptor.
- Bond level and XP.
- Kills and major kills.
- Resurrections.
- Distance traveled with the owner.
- First hired day.
- Companion age.
- Favorite food.

Companions normally begin between 18 and 35 years old and age visually over time. Legacy companions receive missing personality data once without being repeatedly rerolled.

The Journal edit menu supports:

- Name
- Age
- Bio
- Skin URL

Name, Age, and Bio updates are owner-checked and persistent. Skin editing uses HTTP(S) URLs.

### Trait Effects

- **Brave:** More damage and closer following.
- **Cautious:** Greater following distance and slower movement.
- **Guardian:** Increased armor.
- **Reckless:** Increased movement speed and closer following.
- **Stalwart:** Knockback resistance.
- **Quickstep:** Increased movement and following speed.
- **Glutton:** Increased Bond XP from feeding.
- **Disciplined:** Increased XP gain and reduced Morale loss.
- **Lucky:** Chance to duplicate one kill drop.
- **Night Owl:** Damage and speed bonuses at night.
- **Sun-Blessed:** Damage and speed bonuses during the day.
- **Jokester:** Reduced Morale loss.
- **Melancholic:** Minor damage penalty at low Morale.
- **Devoted:** Increased armor and Bond XP.

## Items and Crafting

### Weapons

Modern Companions adds vanilla-style recipes for every custom weapon and material combination. Bronze variants appear when a compatible bronze mod is installed. All custom weapons accept the standard sword-compatible combat, durability, and repair enchantments in survival.

![Weapons](https://i.imgur.com/vJeU7FG.png)

### Companion Mover

The owner-only Companion Mover stores a companion as a glinting item while preserving its identity, UUID, inventory, equipment, stats, and personality.

![Companion Mover](https://i.imgur.com/wKsYkiP.png)

### Soul Gems

Soul Gems preserve a companion’s soul through the Companion Mover and allow later redeployment.

![Soul Gem](https://i.imgur.com/1FrL94k.png)

### Summoning Wand

The Summoning Wand recalls all living companions and Beastmaster pets in the current dimension to a safe location near the owner.

![Summoning Wand](https://i.imgur.com/OClm2Fj.png)

### Assignment Wand

The Assignment Wand links a working companion to a delivery container. Right-click an owned companion with the wand, then sneak-right-click a container. The companion delivers job output there and can withdraw raw inputs when a job supports it.

### Spawn Gems

All companion spawn eggs use class-colored gem artwork and are available on the Modern Companions creative tab. Survival acquisition is left to modpack makers and datapacks.

![Spawn Gems](https://i.imgur.com/nHlP3mX.png)

![Spawn Gems](https://i.imgur.com/Ddy3yEk.png)

### Resurrection Scroll

Tamed companions drop Resurrection Scrolls containing their saved stats, equipment, inventory, and personality data.

Activate a scroll with a Nether Star in the offhand, then use it on a block or fluid face to respawn the companion at that location.

![Resurrection Scroll](https://i.imgur.com/NV1urK6.png)

![Resurrection Scroll](https://i.imgur.com/K8Zl7ka.png)

Harmful effects and optional radiation are cleared from the resurrection data so a revived companion does not immediately repeat the same fatal condition.

## Attribute Enchantments

**Empower, Nimbility, Enlightenment, and Vitality** add Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Endurance bonuses through companion armor.

Levels I–III are available.

![Attribute Enchantments](https://i.imgur.com/NDqdrXP.png)

Books can appear in dungeon, mineshaft, stronghold library, temple, buried treasure, and shipwreck loot.

## Jobs

Jobs are disabled in the player-facing screen by default while the system remains experimental. Set `showJobsButton = true` under `[jobs]` in `config/modern_companions-common.toml` to expose the Jobs button. The Jobs category is intentionally hidden from the native config screen for now.

Available jobs:

- **Lumberjack:** Finds mature natural trees, chops them with an axe, collects logs, and replants when possible.
- **Hunter:** Tracks configured hunt targets with a sword, axe, bow, or crossbow and collects the results.
- **Miner:** Surveys the work area and safely tunnels to configured ore targets with a pickaxe.
- **Fisher:** Finds water, fishes with a fishing rod, and collects catches.
- **Chef:** Uses raw food, cooking recipes, and nearby campfires, soul campfires, furnaces, or smokers. Furnaces and smokers need fuel.

To use a job, assign it in the Jobs screen, give the companion the required tool, and bind a delivery container with the Assignment Wand. The **Work** control starts or pauses the job. Job phases and waiting reasons are shown in the worker panel; combat, blocked routes, full inventories, and unavailable chests preserve the job checkpoint for later resumption.

## Optional Mod Compatibility

All integrations are optional unless listed under Requirements. Content that depends on an absent mod is not registered.

| Mod | Integration |
| --- | --- |
| **Iron's Spellbooks** | Enables magic companions and their native spell API. |
| **Ars Nouveau** | Enables magic companions and their native spell API. Install either magic mod for the nine optional magic roles; both can be used together. |

| **Curios** | Adds companion Curios slots, accessory rendering, and per-slot render toggles. |

Bundled weapon families include matching Epic Fight capabilities. TacZ guns temporarily use TacZ's native pose; a gun stored in cargo does not disable Epic Fight melee. |

| **WTHIT** | Shows companion data in WTHIT tooltips. |
| **JEI** | Adds the custom-vessel brewing steps to JEI's brewing category. Modern Companions does not ship a dedicated REI plugin. |

| **Bronze weapon providers** | Registers bronze dagger, club, hammer, spear, quarterstaff, and glaive variants when the `bronze` mod ID is present. |
| **Mekanism** | Clears Mekanism entity radiation when a companion is resurrected. |

Epic Fight's optional `Epic Fight x Curios Compat` layer is also detected when present so Curios accessories can remain attached to Epic Fight companion renderers.

Pack authors can extend `data/modern_companions/tags/entity_type/alert_unsafe.json` with unsafe entity ids. A higher-priority datapack can set `"replace": true` to supply the complete safety policy before `/reload`.
